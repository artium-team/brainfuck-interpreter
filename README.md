# Brainfuck Interpreter
This repository contains a simple Brainfuck interpreter written in Python. Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language that consists of only eight commands: `+`, `-`, `>`, `<`, `.`, `,`, `[`, and `]`. The interpreter reads a Brainfuck program from standard input and executes it.

Usage
To run the interpreter, simply execute the following command:

python bf.py <program.bf>

where program.bf is the Brainfuck program you want to execute.
