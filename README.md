# Brainfuck Interpreter
This repository contains a simple Brainfuck interpreter written in C. Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language that consists of only eight commands: `+`, `-`, `>`, `<`, `.`, `,`, `[`, and `]`. The interpreter reads a Brainfuck program from standard input and executes it.

# Usage

You need to compile this program before you can run it:

```
gcc -o main main.c
```

To run the interpreter, simply execute the following command:

```
./main program.bf
```
